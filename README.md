####Instructions:

Clone repo and then

`yarn install`<br>
`yarn start`

This covers the mandatory requirements (working game) plus choose players task. You can switch between users by clicking on player name in the top left corner. User's highest completed level persists in local storage. Upon creation, users enter their preffered starting level, but that is not implemented yet. Instead, all users start on default level `minLevel` set in `/src/constants.js` .

All this was completed in 2.5 days so minor bugs are expected. Top score and graph tasks are not completed.
